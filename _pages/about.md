I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Cognitive Science at the [Institut Jean Nicod](https://www.institutnicod.org/) at the [École Normale Supérieure de Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en?lang=en), specializing in linguistics under the supervision of [Benjamin Spector](https://sites.google.com/site/bspectorpage/Home?authuser=0). My work focuses on natural language semantics, pragmatics, and the cross-linguistic study of plurality. My background is in cognitive science, mathematics and Chinese studies. I am funded by the  [Fondation CFM pour la Recherche](https://www.fondation-cfm.org/en).
